# OpenTofu

The VMs and containers on Proxmox as code, with
[OpenTofu](https://opentofu.org/) and the
[bpg/proxmox](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/bpg/proxmox/latest)
provider.

## Why OpenTofu

Terraform is what I use at work. OpenTofu is its open source fork, under
the Linux Foundation, and reads the same HCL and providers. It also has
state encryption built in, which Terraform does not, and that matters in
a public repo: the state holds the Talos machine secrets.

## Proxmox user and role

OpenTofu does not use `root`. It gets its own user with a role that holds
only what the provider needs. Both are created by the Ansible playbook
([03. Ansible](03-ansible.md)) and checked on every run.

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| User | `tofu@pve`, no password, so it cannot log in to the web UI |
| Role | `TofuProvisioner`, granted on `/` |
| Token | `tofu@pve!opentofu`, privilege separation off |

The role's privileges:

| Privilege | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| `Datastore.AllocateSpace`, `Datastore.Audit` | Create VM and container disks |
| `Datastore.AllocateTemplate` | Download the Talos ISO and the container template |
| `SDN.Use` | Attach VMs to `vmbr0` |
| `Sys.Audit` | Read node information |
| `Sys.Modify` | Required by the ISO download API. The broadest one here |
| `VM.Allocate`, `VM.Audit`, `VM.Clone`, `VM.PowerMgmt` | Create, read, clone, start and stop VMs and containers |
| `VM.Config.*` (CD-ROM, CPU, Cloudinit, Disk, HWType, Memory, Network, Options) | Configure them |
| `VM.GuestAgent.Audit` | Read the IPs reported by the guest agent |

Not included: managing users, permissions, realms or groups, the console,
host power, backups, snapshots and migration.

**Privilege separation off:** the token gets exactly the user's
permissions. With it on, the token needs its own permission entry and
gets the overlap of both. That helps when a user has broad rights and a
token should only get a slice; `tofu@pve` has nothing but this role, so
it would only mean managing the same permissions twice.

## API token

Created by hand, since it is a secret, in **Datacenter → Permissions →
API Tokens → Add**:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| User | `tofu@pve` |
| Token ID | `opentofu` |
| Privilege Separation | unticked |
| Expire | never |

The popup shows the secret once. It went straight into a SOPS file (see
[04. Secrets](04-secrets.md)), from a terminal outside the editor:

```bash
EDITOR=nano sops secrets/opentofu.sops.yaml
```

```yaml
proxmox_api_token: "tofu@pve!opentofu=<secret>"
```

The format is the token ID, `=`, then the secret. Checks that never print
the secret:

```bash
grep -c "ENC\[" secrets/opentofu.sops.yaml   # 2: one value plus the SOPS MAC
curl -sk -H "Authorization: PVEAPIToken=$(sops decrypt --extract '["proxmox_api_token"]' secrets/opentofu.sops.yaml)" \
  https://pve.<tailnet>.ts.net:8006/api2/json/version   # version 9.2.20
```

Without the header the same request gets `401`. There is no copy in
Bitwarden: if the file is lost, the token is removed and a new one made.
